# image-transformation-and-filtering
This is the repository for Task 2 of Image Processing and Interpretation : Image Transformation and Filtering using MATLAB

## What is this project about?
We implement many operations to filter the image, such as low-pass filter, high-pass filter, high-boost filter and notch filter. We also make GUI for those operations, so it can load image that you desire. This project is implemented using MATLAB.

## How to run the GUI?
1. Make sure you've installed MATLAB on your device.
2. Go to ```src/``` folder.
3. Double-click ```app.mlapp```.
4. A window will be opened and the GUI is being run and every tab is already initiated with images.
5. Sample images for every task can be found in the 'images' folder.
